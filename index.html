        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Gouranga Bhattacherjee, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating dynamic and responsive
            web applications. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn new
            technologies and improve my skills. I enjoy solving complex problems and turning ideas into reality through
            code. In my free time, I love exploring new programming languages and frameworks, as well as contributing to
            open-source projects. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on innovative
            projects that make a difference.</p>
        <p>My goal is to become a full-stack developer and work on projects that have a positive impact on people's
            lives. I believe in the power of technology to transform the world, and I'm committed to using my skills to
            contribute to that transformation. Whether it's building a simple web application or a complex system, I'm
            always up for a challenge and ready to learn from every experience.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some projects that I have created through my learning. Each project showcases my skills and
            dedication to web development.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the details of each project below:</p>
        <!-- this is a project card -->
        <div class="projectcard">
            <h3>Caesar Cipher</h3>
            <p>A simple web application that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. It allows
                users to input text, select a shift value, and see the encrypted or decrypted result instantly.</p>
            <p>This project demonstrates my understanding of string manipulation, user input handling, and basic
                cryptographic concepts. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a clean and intuitive
                user interface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="projectcard">
            <h3>Calculator</h3>
            <p>A simple calculator using JavaScript Switch-case logic. This project allows users to perform basic
                arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a
                user-friendly interface and demonstrates my ability to implement logical operations and handle user
                inputs effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="projectcard">
            <h3>Clock</h3>
            <p>A simple clock using the Date class in JavaScript. This project dynamically displays the current time,
                updating every second to ensure accuracy. It showcases my ability to work with JavaScript's Date object,
                manipulate the DOM, and implement real-time functionality. The clock features a clean design and serves
                as a practical example of integrating JavaScript logic into a web application.</p>
